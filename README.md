## Zookeeper RPM build files

These files facilitate the build of Apache Zookeeper RPMs.

## Usage

* Download the tarball for Apache Zookeeper and place it in the `SOURCES` directory. 
* Execute the build script with the version number of Zookeeper and the release number as parameters.

## Bugs

* This process was not heavily tested. I stopped putting effort into this once
  I created the RPM the way I wanted it.
